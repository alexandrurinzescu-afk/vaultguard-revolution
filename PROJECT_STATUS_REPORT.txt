ISSUES DETECTED:
1. No separate directory named *Vault*Revolution* found under C:\Users\pc (possible rename or missing parent project).
2. Git history is very small (2 commits) - likely early stage or history missing.
3. A marker suggests original rootProject name was "VaultGuardRevolution" (project may have been renamed or partially migrated).

RECOMMENDED NEXT ACTIONS:
1. If you expect a separate "VaultGuardRevolution" folder: restore from backup/zip/other drive or check remote Git origin (if any).
2. If VaultGuard IS the parent project: decide whether to rename root project back to VaultGuardRevolution (settings.gradle.kts) and align package naming.
3. Optional: run a full-disk search during idle time (it can take long) for folders matching *Vault*Revolution*.
