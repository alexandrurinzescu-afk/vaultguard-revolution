# Privacy Policy (Draft)

This document is a **draft** intended to be shown in-app and published on the web for store compliance.

## Overview
VaultGuard Revolution is a security and privacy tool. It is designed with privacy-by-default principles and aims to minimize data collection.

## What we process
- **Biometric-related data** (if enabled): processed only for **user-initiated** authentication flows.
- **Documents** (if you use document scanning/storage features): stored locally and protected using device security and encryption.
- **Diagnostics**: minimal logs intended for debugging; should be redacted and not include sensitive content.

## What we do not do
- We do **not** sell personal data.
- We do **not** perform background biometric capture.
- We do **not** use biometric templates for advertising or tracking.

## Data retention
- Data is retained only as long as needed for the app to function and per user choices.
- A “delete all data” flow must be provided (see roadmap 2.5.4).

## User controls
- You should be able to delete all user data and keys.
- You should be able to export your documents/metadata (see roadmap 2.5.5).

## Contact
TODO: add official contact email and company details before release.
